All user interfaces in the end are made up of components.

Why Components?
- [[Reusability]]
- [[Seperation of Concerns]]

We can use [[JSX]] in our components.
We can pass data between components with [[Props]].

Building a [[User Interface]] from smaller building blocks by passing components as props to other components is called [[Composition]].
