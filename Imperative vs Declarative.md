#react

Vanilla JS -> imperative
React.js (or other JS libraries/ frameworks) -> declarative

⭐️ Code to tell 'what' you want to get something, instead of 'how' to get it.

React.js combines HTML, CSS and JS in a declarative approach:

Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JS [[DOM]] instructions.

[[JSX]] can be used to describe what should be rendered.
