**Manual Testing**
Write code <> Preview & Test in Browser
It is an essential process to see what the users will see, but it is **error-prone** since it is hard to test all possible combinations and scenarios manually. 

**Automated Testing**
Code that tests your code
Tests are written to test the individual building blocks of an app. It is very technical but it allows us to test all these blocks at once.

Different Kinds of Automated Tests:
1. [[Unit Tests]]
2. [[Integration Tests]]
3. [[End-to-End (e2e) Tests]]
